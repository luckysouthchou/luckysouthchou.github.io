I"¥<p>Your time is limited, so donâ€™t waste it living someone elseâ€™s life. Donâ€™t be trapped by dogmaâ€”which is living with results of other peopleâ€™s thinking. Donâ€™t let the noise of othersâ€™ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.
â€”â€”Steve Jobs</p>
